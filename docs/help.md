# Help me!

The following parts require cleanup:

## optimizers

Needs separating into own files, need to extract general optimizing function.

## wrap

Need to clean up and simplify logic, fix bugs (this is probably the source of a few bugs).

## deepMap / deepEquals

Should make these specific to the structures being traversed.
